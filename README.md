# Recipe Concierge

This repository hosts the monorepo for the Recipe Concierge application.
The layout follows a workspace based structure with separate folders for
shared libraries, individual services, infrastructure code and client apps.

See `libs/` for shared code, `services/` for back-end micro services and
`apps/` for front-end packages. Infrastructure configuration resides under
`infra/`.

See [docs/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for instructions on running the example recipe service.
